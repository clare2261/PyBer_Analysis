# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Using Python and the Pandas library to create summary dataframes of a ride-sharing data by city type.  Then using Matplotlib creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  

## Results for Deliverable 1:
Below is a picture of the summary dataframe for each city type.  It is clear that the Urban city type generates the most rides and revenue but the average comes out to be the lowest.

## Results for Deliverable 2:
Below is the bar chart for the total weekly fares by city type for the first 4 months of YR2019.  As you can see the urban areas generate alot more dollars in revenue.  Followed by the suburban and lastly the rural.

## PyBer Summary
Some recomendations supported by the data are 1. The suburban area has 1/3 of the urban rides but half the revenue.  This could be a focus for the Company moving forward.  2.  To entice more drivers in rural areas they could put together a marketing package from this showing how much more average money a driver could make moving out of urban areas and into suburban or rural areas.  3.  January appears to be the slowest month of the four studied.  It might make sense to offer incentives for the other months to get more drivers and fares.
